My dumping ground for learning Go primarily for a tech test that's coming up.


## Resources

### Getting started
- [Install Go here](https://go.dev/learn/)
- [Interactive Tour of Go](https://go.dev/tour/welcome/1)
- [Nana's Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyUHQIec83I) A 3 hour starter. The code for it is [here](https://gitlab.com/nanuchi/go-full-course-youtube).
- [Guided Tutorials](https://go.dev/learn/#guided-learning-journeys)

### Reference
- [Another Course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-golang-handbook/#chapter-15-mutexes-in-go) All text. Looks like a good reference too
- [Go By Example](https://gobyexample.com/) Looks like a bunch of nice reference examples for the different concepts in Go

### Awesome Go
